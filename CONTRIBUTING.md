## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Git installed locally
- Familiarity with Python, machine learning, or computer vision (depending on the project)
- Understanding of the human-elephant conflict context (helpful but not required)

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Fork the repository** you want to contribute to
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git
   cd REPO-NAME
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/AI4HEC/REPO-NAME.git
   ```
4. **Create a new branch** for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üìù Contribution Workflow

### 1. Before You Start
- Check existing issues to see if someone is already working on it
- Create a new issue to discuss major changes before implementing them
- Read the repository's README and documentation

### 2. Making Changes
- Write clear, documented, and tested code
- Follow the coding style of the project
- Keep commits atomic and write meaningful commit messages
- Update documentation if you're changing functionality

### 3. Commit Message Guidelines
Use clear and descriptive commit messages:
```
feat: Add elephant detection model for thermal imagery
fix: Resolve false positive detections in low-light conditions
docs: Update installation instructions for Windows
test: Add unit tests for data preprocessing pipeline
```

Prefixes:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### 4. Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Push your changes** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Open a Pull Request** from your fork to the main repository

3. **Fill out the PR template** with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Related issue numbers
   - Testing performed
   - Screenshots (if applicable)

4. **Respond to feedback** from maintainers

5. **Update your PR** based on review comments

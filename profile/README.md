# AI4HEC – AI for Human–Elephant Conflict

Developing AI-driven technologies to enable safe coexistence between humans and elephants in Sri Lanka.

## 🎯 Mission & Vision

Our long-term goal is to create AI-based solutions that minimize train-elephant collisions, improve early detection, and foster sustainable human–elephant coexistence.

We aim to:
- Develop real-time detection systems for elephant presence near railway tracks
- Create predictive models to anticipate elephant movement patterns
- Design early warning systems for train operators and wildlife authorities
- Support conservation efforts through data-driven insights
- Promote harmonious coexistence between communities and wildlife
